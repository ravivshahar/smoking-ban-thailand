        <h2>New Law Targets Underage Smoking</h2>
        <p>As of December 2024, Thailand has introduced one of the strictest smoking bans in the world, specifically targeting minors under the age of <span class="highlight">18</span>. This new legislation aims to combat the rising number of young smokers and protect public health.</p>

        <h2>What Does the Law Say?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Smoking is strictly prohibited</span> for anyone under the age of 18.</li>
            <li>If caught smoking in public, minors could face a <span class="highlight">fine of 5,000 THB</span> or up to <span class="highlight">30 days in jail</span>.</li>
            <li>Smoking is also banned <span class="highlight">inside private homes</span>. Concerned neighbors or citizens can report violations, which may result in more severe penalties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Health Risks Associated with Smoking</h2>
        <p>Studies show that smoking at a young age can lead to serious health problems, including lung damage, heart disease, and reduced brain development. The Thai government is taking these steps to ensure a healthier future for its youth.</p>

        <h2>How the Law Is Enforced</h2>
        <p>Thailand's police and local authorities are actively monitoring compliance with the new regulations. Parents and guardians are also held accountable for ensuring their children do not engage in smoking. Repeat offenders could face <span class="highlight">additional penalties</span>, including mandatory counseling sessions.</p>

        <h2>Support for Quitting Smoking</h2>
        <p>The Thai government has also introduced various support programs to help minors quit smoking. Free hotlines, counseling, and nicotine replacement therapies are now available nationwide.</p>

        <h2>Remember</h2>
        <p>The penalties are severe, and the government is committed to enforcing this law. Protect yourself and your family by avoiding smoking and encouraging others to do the same.</p>

        <p class="highlight">Stay safe and follow the law!</p>
